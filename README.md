# Render programmer

Currently in my free time focusing on Vulkan, GPU driven renderer development. Working as game render programmer. I was inspired by demoscene, games and UNIX to get into low level programming. Now mostly twiddling bits on GPU.

On non-computer related side of things I like obscure and inspiring games; weird, atmospheric and moody music; futuristic aesthetics and other interactive experiences.
